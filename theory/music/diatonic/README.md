## notes on Foundations of Diatonic Theory

Foundations of Diatonic Theory: A Mathematically Based Approach to Music Fundamentals is an introductory, undergraduate-level textbook that provides an easy entry point into the challenging field of diatonic set theory, a division of music theory that applies the techniques of discrete mathematics to the properties of diatonic scales. After introducing mathematical concepts that relate directly to music theory, the text concentrates on these mathematical relationships, firmly establishing a link between introductory pedagogy and recent scholarship in music theory. It then relates concepts in diatonic set theory directly to the study of music fundamentals through pedagogical exercises and instructions.

Ideal for introductory music majors, the book requires only a general knowledge of mathematics, and the exercises are provided with solutions and detailed explanations. With its basic description of musical elements, this textbook is suitable for courses in music fundamentals, music theory for non-music majors, music and mathematics, and other similar courses that allow students to improve their mathematics skills while pursuing the study of music.
