The Formula 

100+Chord Progressions 



“Why the hell would you even make a guide like this? Clearly there is no one formula to summarise all of 
Nirvana’s work, right?" 
Right. My intention withthis PDFis to a)give you a quickstartinto writing grungy chord progressions next 
time you’re sitting down to write and b) to understand Nirvana’s band sound better. I’m notclaiming that 
using this formula willturn you into the nextKurtCobain, butmaybe itwillhelp you find your unique sound. 
The Mindset 
www.holistic-songwriting.com1) Power Chords only 
Cobain almostexclusivelyuses Power Chords. He mightoccasionallyadd a fifthon top (1-5-8-5instead of 
1-5or 1-5-8)when he’s playing inDrop Dthough (otherwise thisvoicing is veryuncomfortable to play). 
2) Write in Major, then simplify 
Even though power chords are neither major or minor, mostofNirvana’schord progressions havea major feel 
to them (mostsongs haveno morethan 1minor chord -i.e. Lithium is D -F# -Bm -G -Bb -C -A -C). When 
writing your melody, playallchords as major triads and adapt the melody. Your melody willsound grungier 
this way. When you’refinished writing your melody, simplifythe chords to power chords again. 
2 crucial things to remember: 

Symbols! Formulas! What???

"You’re using new terminology for this PDF than classical music theory. Why?” 
Because Cobain wasn’tthinking in classicalmusic theoryterms. Using functionalharmonyto describe whathe’s 
doing reads rather unpleasantlybecause he often changes keymid-song or uses (traditionally)nonsensicalchords. 
As you willsee, the terminology I use has more to do withthe actualchord-to-chord movementthan how the chords 
relate to the key(similar to Neo-RiemannianTheory). This mirrors how a guitaristwithno musicaleducation 
approaches chords:visually(notthinking in terms of “thirds” butin terms of “moving up 3steps”). 
The terminology explained 
X, Y, Z:anychords thatare differentfrom one another (these willbe power chords) 
(M):major feel, i.e. even though this chord willbe a power chord, write your melody playing a major triad here. 
(r): the bass note from this power chord comes from the relative key, i.e. ifyour chord progression is setin Cmajor, this willbe a 
bass note from Cminor. 
b3, 3, 4: move a minor third (3halfsteps), a major third (4halfsteps)or a fourth(5halfsteps)to getto this power chord. 
b3: move a minor third (3halfsteps)to getto this power chord. 
+, -, ±: move up, down or either (you choose). 
Example: 
X+b3±4(M)-b3/3reads as starton any power chord, moveUPaminor third(3halfsteps), choose whether to move upor down a 4th(5 
halfsteps)and playthatchordas a major chord,then move down either a minor third(3halfsteps)or amajor third(4halfsteps). So 
this formula couldmean: C5-Eb5-Ab-F or C5-Eb5-Ab-Fb5or C5-Eb5-Bb5-G5or C5-Eb5-Bb5-Gb5.

Formula #1: X(M)±b3(M) 
www.holistic-songwriting.com
“I want to write a simple, 2-chord chorus in the style of Nirvana. What chord progression 
would you recommend?” 
Ohme, you alwaysaskthe bestquestions, you handsome devil, you. Let’s startwiththis 
classic Nirvana chord progression, found inIn Bloom, Come As YouAreand Drain You. 
Examples 
C-Eb:In traditionalharmony, this would be called moving up to the chromatic mediant. 
C-Ab:In traditionalharmony, this would be called moving down to the chromatic mediant. 
In classical terms:I-bIII or I-bVI

Formula #2: X(M)±4(M)+b3(M)±Y(r,M) 
www.holistic-songwriting.com“I was always bad at maths. Could you explain this in plain English?” 
Anything for you, voice-in-my-head-that-tells-me-to-kick-toddlers. Starton anypower chord and move 
up or down 5halfsteps. Then move up 3halfsteps (when you’re writing a melody to your chord 
progression, playthis as a major chord). End on a major chord builton a bass note from the relative 
minor key. When you’re writing a melody to these chords, allchords countas major chords.

Formula #3: X±b3/3±Y(M)+b3(M) 
www.holistic-songwriting.com“This looks complicated.” 
It looks more complicated than itis. Justgo through itstep bystep and you’llbe fine. 
Justpicka starting chord and move up or down a minor or major third. Thenpickanother 
chord and move up a minor third.

“I want more chord progressions!” 
If you wantto craftyour own Nirvana-esque chord progressions, I gotone more for tip you:AlotofNirvana’s chord 
progressions are builton sequencing outchord movement. In other words, you starton a chord (X), move that 
chord somewhere and remember byhow manysemitones (±?)you moved. Then you go to anyother chord (Y)and 
do thatsame move (±?)again. Allofthis iseasiestto see on guitar where the chord shapes give you a visualclue. 
Formula #4: X ±? ±Y ±? 
www.holistic-songwriting.comExample: 
You startoutin Cand randomlymove to F. That’sup a fourth(5semitones up). So X=Cand ±?=+5. Now all 
you have to do ispickanother random chord Y. Sayyou pickEb. Thatwillmakethe lastchord (Eb+5 
semitones=)Ab. So your finalchord progression willread: 
C-F-Eb-Ab 
Here’s a few more examples using different intervals and random Y-chords: 
C-G-Eb-Bb (up a fifth), C-G-D-A(up a fifth), C-Ab-B-G(down a major third), C-F#-Eb-A(down a tritone), etc.
