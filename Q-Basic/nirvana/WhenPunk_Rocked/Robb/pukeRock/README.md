## oral history of punk rock

```ascii
With its own fashion, culture, and chaotic energy, punk rock boasted a do-it-yourself ethos 
that allowed anyone to take part. Vibrant and volatile, the punk scene left an 
extraordinary legacy of music and cultural change. John Robb talks to many of those 
who cultivated the movement, such as John Lydon, Lemmy, Siouxsie Sioux, Mick Jones, 
Chrissie Hynde, Malcolm McLaren, Henry Rollins, and Glen Matlock, weaving together 
their accounts to create a raw and unprecedented oral history of UK punk. 
All the main players are here: from The Clash to Crass, from The Sex Pistols to the 
Stranglers, from the UK Subs to Buzzcocks—over 150 interviews capture the excitement 
of the most thrilling wave of rock ’n’ roll pop culture ever. Ranging from its widely 
debated roots in the late 1960s to its enduring influence on the bands, fashion, and 
culture of today, this history brings to life the energy and the anarchy as no other book has done.
