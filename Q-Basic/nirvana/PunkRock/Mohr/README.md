## notes on 'Burning Down the Haus: Punk Rock, Revolution, and the Fall of the Berlin Wall'

```text
“A thrilling and essential social history that details the rebellious youth movement
that helped change the world.” —Rolling Stone

“Original and inspiring . . . Mr. Mohr has writ­ten an im­por­tant work of Cold War
cul­tural his­tory.” —The Wall Street Journal

“Wildly entertaining . . . A thrilling tale . . . A joy in the way it brings back punk’s
fury and high stakes.” —Vogue

It began with a handful of East Berlin teens who heard the Sex Pistols on a British military radio
broadcast to troops in West Berlin, and it ended with the collapse of the East German dictatorship.
Punk rock was a life-changing discovery. The buzz-saw guitars, the messed-up clothing and hair,
the rejection of society and the DIY approach to building a new one:
in their gray surroundings, where everyone’s future was preordained by some communist apparatchik,
punk represented a revolutionary philosophy—quite literally, as it turned out.

But as these young kids tried to form bands and became more visible, security
forces—including the dreaded secret police, the Stasi—targeted them. They were spied on by
friends and even members of their own families; they were expelled from schools and fired from jobs;
they were beaten by police and imprisoned. Instead of conforming, the punks fought back, playing an
indispensable role in the underground movements that helped bring down the Berlin Wall.

This secret history of East German punk rock is not just about the music; it is a story of
extraordinary bravery in the face of one of the most oppressive regimes in history. Rollicking,
cinematic, deeply researched, highly readable, and thrillingly topical,
BurningDown the Haus brings to life the young men and women who successfully
fought authoritarianism three chords at a time—and is a fiery testament to the irrepressible
spirit of revolution.
