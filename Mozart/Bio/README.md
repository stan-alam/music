## Notes on Life of Mozart

```text
from youtube:
QUOTES from the conductor Sir Colin Davis. "He appeared to have the most
astounding inner freedom which functioned absolutely independently from the
circumstances of his life. You’d think that when he was in all that debt and
his whole life was crumbling that something would have given way - not all all -
he wrote his greatest pieces (then). He wrote a few string quintets that turned
out to be the greatest chamber music we have. He wrote three symphonies and
threw them in a drawer. And his circumstances were awful." "Mozart made life
extraordinarily difficult for those who came after him. Beethoven had the most
problems of course because he was the immediate successor to Mozart." "
The intellectual competence of Mozart was something that Beethoven really
never achieved. Mozart had no problems - he had absolutely no problems in
expressing himself. He could do ANYTHING."
