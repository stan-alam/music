## notes on 'Mozartiana'

Mozartiana is a surprising, eccentric, and enchanting testament to the genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Artist Joseph Solman has gathered opinions, remembrances, letters, and more-from Albert Einstein, Virginia Woolf, Friedrich Nietzsche, Leonard Bernstein, Maurice Sendak, and some 200 others-and blended them with his own sketches and drawings of the great composer. The result is a glorious celebration of Mozart's life and art, and a unique gift to music lovers everywhere.
