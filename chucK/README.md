Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists: Creating Music with ChucK offers a
complete introduction to programming in the open source music language ChucK. In it,
you’ll learn the basics of digital sound creation and manipulation while you discover
the ChucK language. As you move example-by-example through this easy-to-follow book,
you’ll create meaningful and rewarding digital compositions and “instruments” that
make sound and music in direct response to program logic, scores, gestures, and other
systems connected via MIDI or the network.
A digital musician must manipulate sound precisely. ChucK is an audio-centric programming
language that provides precise control over time, audio computation, and user interface
elements like track pads and joysticks. Because it uses the vocabulary of sound, ChucK
is easy to learn even for artists with little or no exposure to computer programming.

how ChucK enables the on-the-fly musical improvisation practiced by communities of “live music coders”
around the world.
Written for readers familiar with the vocabulary of sound and music. No experience with computer
programming is required.
