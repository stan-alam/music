By the 1840s Joseph Haydn, who died in 1809 as the most celebrated composer of his
generation, had degenerated into the bewigged "Papa Haydn," a shallow placeholder in
music history who merely invented the forms used by Beethoven. In a remarkable reversal,
Haydn swiftly regained his former stature within the opening decades of the twentieth
century. Reviving Haydn: New Appreciations in the Twentieth Century examines both the
decline and the subsequent resurgence of Haydn's reputation in an effort to better
understand the forces that shape critical reception on a broad scale. No single person
or event marked the turning point for Haydn's reputation. Instead a broad resurgence
reshaped opinion in Europe and the United States in short order. The Haydn revival
engaged many of the music world's leading figures -- composers (Vincent d'Indy and
Arnold Schoenberg), conductors (Arturo Toscanini), performers (Wanda Landowska),
critics (Lawrence Gilman), and scholars (Heinrich Schenker and Donald Tovey) -- each
of whom valued Haydn's music for specific reasons and used it to advance particular
goals. Yet each advocated for a rehearing and rereading of the composer's works,
calling for a new appreciation of Haydn's music. Bryan Proksch is assistant
professor of music history at Lamar University.
