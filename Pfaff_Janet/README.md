As a parent with a real life-changing experience, I want to share the story of how I lost my daughter, Kristen Pfaff, the bass guitarist in the band Hole, to an accidental heroin overdose in Seattle, Washington on June 15, 1994. I wish to let the reader know what she accomplished in her short life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I found taking her to school gave me mixed feelings. She seemed more prepared than I was. It was not easy for this emotional Italian mother to let go of her daughter. This is how I recall it: The alarm rang. This was it! It was the first day of school and my little girl was leaving the nest. As I lay in bed procrastinating, my daughter Kristen peeked around the corner as perky and chipper as usual asking for breakfast. We stepped into the kitchen, where I fixed her what she wanted on this special day: pancakes, sausage and juice. I recall not being particularly hungry. Actually, I felt a bit nauseous. Who could eat at a time like this? Kristen could, of course. After breakfast, we started to get ready. While combing her lovely jet black hair, I looked at Kristen with pride. She was so lovely with her hazel eyes and fair skin. She looked like a china doll as we put on her new red plaid school dress. I looked Chinese as well with the slanted eyes I had from lack of sleep. I insisted on walking her to school despite her protests, refusing to let go until the last minute. I was hanging on until the bitter end. I knew Kristen would be all right when I tearfully waved good bye and she nonchalantly looked up as if to say, “Are you still here?”|

I suspect this writing referred to Kristen as she saw herself wearing her brace. Again she turned this writing into an essay which earned her another “A” in her English class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

While Frankenstein’s creation undoubtedly fits the physical criteria mentioned above, only Victor Frankenstein himself is spiritually disfigured. At times one wonders whether he indeed is human, or has he manifested inwardly what the monster portrays outwardly? In proving the ultimate innocence and goodness of the monster, it is important to not only examine his actions, but the motivation that prompted them, and also his feelings afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Victor felt that his creation would be a new and perfect specimen of life, that “a new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.” However, when the creature is finally bestowed with life, Victor flees into his chambers, unable to acknowledge the hideous form as his creation. Later that evening, the monster makes an attempt at contact with his master, but Victor is overcome with fear and leaves both his home and his creation behind. Therefore, at the very onset of his existence, the creature is abandoned and left with no friend or companion to guide him. He is forced to survive on his own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
