## linear mapping of light spectra from celestial object to melodic patterns based on Lucy Tuning.
## Similar to Pythagoras/Kepler music of the spheres." In lieu of using geometric intervals between astronomical objects, I will be using  
## the wavelengths within the electromagnetic radiation.

## Objective:

**1. transform stuff from The observable universe to music.** --colloquially speaking

**2. Learn a little Python on the way**

**3. This will serve as my independent study project in DataScience**

**4. Learn music theory (and a little math)**

**5. Most of all having fun**

### I will be using Python to process datasets into patterns/melodies from various astronomical organizations
### I may also use the Java JFugue API not all inclusive to Python

Audible frequencies are from 20 Hz. to 25,000 Hz.

the speed of light is  299,792,458 meters per second. The wave length of a particular color may be expressed in meters (nanometers or Angstroms).
299,792,458 meters is equivalent to a number of wavelengths, which may be determined by dividing 299,792,458 by the distance in meters of one wavelength.
i.e. frequency = (meters traveled by light per second) _ (wavelength of specific color)

E.g: for 5800 Angstroms (yellow) Frequency = 299,792,458 / 0.000,000,58 = 516,883,530,000,000 Hz.

### As octaves are a result of doubling or halving frequency this high frequency may be reduced to a precise audible value by cumulative halving.

Take 516,883,530,000,000 hertz divide by 2 that means one octave lower.

258,441,765,000,000 then divide that by 2 an octave lower

129,220,882,500,000 / 2

64,610,441,250,000 divide this by 2 again

you do this eight times from 516,883,530,000,000 hertz

you will arrive at 470.102 hertz.

Which is Bb, while B flat on the guitar is =  472.27 hertz
So that frequency is mapped to B flat

the A note is 440 hertz

A 440-------------------- 437.832 Orange-Yellow
A# 457.75----------------   455.582 Yellow-Orange
Bb 472.27-----------------    470.102 Yellow
