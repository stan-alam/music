Audible frequencies are from 20 Hz. to 25,000 Hz.

the speed of light is  299,792,458 meters per second. The wave length of a particular color may be expressed in meters (nanometers or Angstroms).
299,792,458 meters is equivalent to a number of wavelengths, which may be determined by dividing 299,792,458 by the distance in meters of one wavelength.
i.e. frequency = (meters traveled by light per second) _ (wavelength of specific color)

E.g: for 5800 Angstroms (yellow) Frequency = 299,792,458 / 0.000,000,58 = 516,883,530,000,000 Hz.

As octaves are a result of doubling or halving frequency this high frequency may be reduced to a precise audible value by cumulative halving.

Take 516,883,530,000,000 hertz divide by 2 that means one octave lower.

258,441,765,000,000 then divide that by 2 an octave lower

129,220,882,500,000 / 2

64,610,441,250,000  then divide by 2 again


you do this for 8 times from 516,883,530,000,000 hertz

and you will get 470.102 hertz so
which is Bb because  B flat on the guitar is =  472.27 hertz
So that light is = to B flat

the A note is 440 hertz


A 440-------------------- 437.832 Orange-Yellow
A# 457.75-------------- 455.582 Yellow-Orange


Bb 472.27---------------            470.102 Yellow
