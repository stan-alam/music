## linear mapping of light spectra from celestial object to musical notes based on Lucy Tuning.
## Similar to Pythagoras/Kepler, "music of the spheres."
          In lieu of using geometric intervals between astronomical objects, I will be using  
          the wavelengths within the electromagnetic radiation.

Presently, human beings can observe the light emitted from stars and deduce the chemical composition of these celestial objects through the use of the
spectrometer. The main idea of the project was inspired in the late 1990s and early 2000s using Q-Basic and the Pascal programming language. I was using Turbo Pascal 6.0, sound(), and delay(). Pascal's sound function does not support floating point values, and because of this, I became limited to the c-major and a-minor scales. (no accidentals)The data sets and technological advancements such as hardware, APIs, and programming toolsets were not available at the time. I was using a 1994-95 era 80486 DX2, 66 Mhz - Packard Bell 251CD Axcel desktop, 14 k modem, 8 megabytes of R.A.M, Windows 3.11, MS-DOS 6.22. Currently, access to the vast datasets is open to the public and available for high-speed download; various programming tools have also been developed since 1995 (which are "light years" ahead of what was available for the programming/music hobbyist/enthusiast—relatively speaking).

## Objective:

**1. transform stuff from The observable universe to music.** --colloquially speaking

**2. Learn a little more Python on the way**

**3. This will serve as my independent study project in DataScience**

**4. Learn music theory ( and apply mathematical rigor )**

**5. Oh, and this is for fun, anyone can join!**

### I will be using Python to process datasets from the various astronomical organizations and convert these patterns into music.
### I may also use the Java JFugue API (not all inclusive to Python)

Audible frequencies are from 20 Hz. to 25,000 Hz.

the speed of light is  299,792,458 meters per second. The wave length of a particular color may be expressed in meters (nanometers or Angstroms).
299,792,458 meters is equivalent to a number of wavelengths, which may be determined by dividing 299,792,458 by the distance in meters of one wavelength.
i.e. frequency = (meters traveled by light per second) _ (wavelength of specific color)

E.g: for 5800 Angstroms (yellow) Frequency = 299,792,458 / 0.000,000,58 = 516,883,530,000,000 Hz.

### As octaves are a result of doubling or halving frequency this high frequency may be reduced to a precise audible value by cumulative halving.

Take 516,883,530,000,000 hertz divide this value by 2. ( an octave lower )

258,441,765,000,000 this value is again divided by 2 ( an octave lower )

(129,220,882,500,000 / 2)

64,610,441,250,000 divide this by 2 again

you do this eight times from 516,883,530,000,000 hertz

you will arrive at 470.102 hertz.

Which is Bb, while B flat on the guitar is 472.27 hertz
So this particular frequency is mapped to B flat

String frequencies of standard tuning

    String	    Frequency	       Scientific pitch notation

    1 (E)	  329.63 Hz	       E4

    2 (B)	  246.94 Hz	       B3

    3 (G)	  196.00 Hz	       G3

    4 (D)	  146.83 Hz	       D3

    5 (A)	  110.00 Hz	       A2   

    6 (E)	  82.41 Hz	       E2


the Orchestral A note is 440 hertz, the guitar A note open 5th string is 110 hertz two octaves lower.

	A 440 - >    437.832 Orange-Yellow
	A# 457.75 -> 455.582 Yellow-Orange
	Bb 472.27 -> 470.102 Yellow

"Anyone can use Dataset Search, which is still in beta, but Google emphasizes the benefits it has for journalists and data scientists.

    “In today’s world, scientists in many disciplines and a growing number of journalists live and breathe data… To enable easy access to this data, we launched Dataset Search, so that scientists, data journalists, data geeks, or anyone else can find the data required for their work and their stories, or simply to satisfy their intellectual curiosity.”

Dataset Search surfaces results from publishers’ sites, digital libraries, and authors’ personal web pages.

Google’s new search engine is largely dependent on the schema markup for dataset providers that was rolled out in July."
